He argues that Austen's first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, embodies her most sustained effort at correcting dominant concepts of gender in her era. Through an engaging, often witty analysis of the text, he demonstrates how the novel's protagonists deviate from ruling ideas of their sexes and reveal Austen's own feminist tendencies.By comparing Elinor Dashwood to Austen's other female protagonists, Perkins argues that she alone exemplified a type of heroine unique for her time and still unacknowledged: an intellectual. With her acute sense of honor and her commitment to civic responsibility, Elinor is one of Austen's most complex constructions. Perkins also shows that Elinor's passions are more intense and interesting than many readers have seen. Critics have described Marianne Dashwood's love ethic as emotive and her illness as brought on by Freudian repression, but Perkins finds her sexually unrepressed and rational in her ethic. Edward Ferrars's modesty, shyness as lover, and merely domestic ambitions also challenge gender stereotypes. Yet his wit, moral courage, and farmerly practicality enrich his portrait in a way that helps us appreciate Elinor's love.Perkins prefers to scrutinize, not theorize. Seeking reconstruction, never reconstruction, he offers new readings of puzzling actions, such as Marianne's marrying Colonel Brandon, and Elinor's assisting Brandon to enable Edward to marry her \"fair rival\".Perkins shows that this underestimated novel offers important insights into Austen'snotion of what a woman can be and a man should be, and into the deeply social conception of felt emotion that drives and structures her fiction.

Who was the man who was rumored to have been kept in prison and treated royally during much of the reign of Louis XIV while being forced to wear an iron mask? Could he possibly have been the twin brother of the Sun King? Like every other serious scholar, intrepid historian Paul Sonnino discounts this theory, instead taking the reader along on his adventures to uncover the truth behind this ancient enigma. Exploring the hidden, squalid side of the lavish court of France, the author uncovers the full spectrum of French society, from humble servants to wealthy merchants to kings and queens. All had self-interested reasons to hold their secrets close until one humble valet named Eustache Dauger was arrested and jailed for decades, simply because he knew too much and opened his mouth at the wrong time. Presenting his dramatic solution to the mystery, Sonnino convincingly shows that no one will be able to tell the story of the man in the iron mask without taking into account the staggering array of evidence he has uncovered over the course of decades."}, {"id": "10743", "title": "Moonfleet", "genre": "Adventure", "language": "en", "author": "J Meade Falkner", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3NNmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10743/10743-h/10743-h.htm", "desc": "\"This Dover edition, first published in 2018, is an unabridged republication of the work originally published in 1898 by Edward Arnold Publishers Ltd, London\"--"}, {"id": "2727", "title": "Allans Wife", "genre": "Adventure", "language": "en", "author": "Henry Rider Haggard", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FCE1AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2727/2727-h/2727-h.htm", "desc": "The tale of Allan Quatermain's second wife, Stella, is a classic fantasy African adventure, complete with magic and ghosts, plus Haggard's trademark gripping narrative style."}, {"id": "5746", "title": "The Ancient Allan", "genre": "Adventure", "language": "en", "author": "Henry Rider Haggard", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PpQ9AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5746/5746-h/5746-h.htm", "desc": "While under the influence of a drug, Allan Quatermain experiences one of his past lives, previous incarnation in ancient Egypt.

No ordinary woman, Red Knot was the heir to the Greenstone Clan and the future leader of the independent villages. Her death has shattered all alliances and left a power void that several ambitious clan chiefs see as their destiny to fill.

Feared as a sorcerer, The Panther is the only one with the power to demand to be heard by all.

The water, clear and deep, coming through rocky soil, babbled gently at the edges, where it lapped the land, but in the center the full current flowed steadily and without noise.The thin shadows of early dusk were falling, casting a pallid tint over the world, a tint touched here and there with living fire from the sun, which was gone, though leaving burning embers behind. One glowing shaft, piercing straight through the heavy forest that clothed either bank, fell directly upon the figure in the boat, as a hidden light illuminates a great picture, while the rest is left in shadow. It was no common forest runner who sat in the middle of the red beam. Yet a boy, in nothing but years, he swung the great paddle with an ease and vigor that the strongest man in the West might have envied. His rifle, with the stock carved beautifully, and the long, slender blue barrel of the border, lay by his side. He could bring the paddle into the boat, grasp the rifle, and carry it to his shoulder with a single, continuous movement.His most remarkable aspect, one that the casual observer even would have noticed, was an extraordinary vitality. He created in the minds of those who saw him a feeling that he lived intensely every moment of his life. Born and-bred in the forest, he was essentially its child, a perfect physical being, trained by the utmost hardship and danger, and with every faculty, mental and physical, in complete coordination. It is only by a singular combination of time and place, and only once in millions of chances, that Nature produces such a being.The canoe remained a few moments in the center of the red light, and its occupant, with a slight swaying motion of the paddle, held it steady in the current, while he listened. Every feature stood out in the glow, the firm chin, the straight strong nose, the blue eyes, and the thick yellow hair. The red blue, and yellow beads on his dress of beautifully tanned deerskin flashed in the brilliant rays. He was the great picture of fact, not of fancy, a human being animated by a living, dauntless soul."}, {"id": "12532", "title": "The Shades of the Wilderness A Story of Lees Great Stand", "genre": "Children", "language": "en", "author": "Joseph Alexander Altsheler", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J6aRzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12532/12532-h/12532-h.htm", "desc": "A train of wagons and men wound slowly over the hills in the darkness and rain toward the South.

The officers gave but few orders, and the cavalrymen who rode on either flank looked solicitously into the wagons now and then to see how their wounded friends fared, though they seldom spoke. The darkness they did not mind, because they were used to it, and the rain and the coolness were a relief, after three days of the fiercest battle the American continent had ever known, fought in the hottest days that the troops could recall.Thus Lee's army drew its long length from the fatal field of Gettysburg, although his valiant brigades did not yet know that the clump of trees upon Cemetery Hill had marked the high tide of the Confederacy.

Our biology is set up to work in partnership with it. From our sleep cycles to our immune systems and our mental health, access to sunlight is crucial for living a happy and fulfilling life. New research suggests that our sun exposure over a lifetime - even before we were born - may shape our risk of developing a range of different illnesses, from depression to diabetes. Bursting with cutting-edge science and eye-opening advice, Chasing the Sun explores the extraordinary significance of sunlight, from ancient solstice celebrations to modern sleep labs, and from the unexpected health benefits of sun exposure to what the Amish know about sleep that the rest of us don't. As more of us move into light-polluted cities, spending our days in dim offices and our evenings watching brightly lit screens, we are in danger of losing something vital: our connection to the star that gave us life.

Written from a concern to understand Western films primarily as products of Hollywood's studio system, it recovers the context in which Westerns were produced, exhibited and viewed in the 1930s. Peter Stanfield highlights the hitherto marginalised 'B' or 'series' Western, the significance of female audiences, the role of independent exhibitors and of censorship in shaping film production. The book includes illustrations from the following films: Arizona, The Big Trail, Billy the Kid, Cimarron, Destry Rides Again, Dodge City, In Old Arizona, In Old Santa Fe, Jesse James, The Lash, Let Freedom Ring, Oh, Susanna!, Oklahoma Kid, The Plainsman, Ramona, Santa Fe Trail, Stand Up and Fight, Three Godfathers, Trail of the Lonesome Pine, Tumbling Tumbleweeds, Union Pacific, Virginia City, The Virginian, and The Westerner."}, {"id": "24097", "title": "The Story of Red Feather A Tale of the American Frontier", "genre": "Children", "language": "en", "author": "Edward Sylvester Ellis", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CTgCAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24097/24097-h/24097-h.htm", "desc": "\"The Story of Red Feather: A Tale of the American Frontier\" by Edward Sylvester Ellis.

The incidents of the contest were of a singularly dramatic character. Upon one side was the greatest power of the time, set in motion by a ruthless bigot, who was determined either to force his religion upon the people of the Netherlands, or to utterly exterminate them. Upon the other were a scanty people, fishermen, sailors, and agriculturalists, broken up into communities with but little bond of sympathy, and no communication, standing only on the defensive, and relying solely upon the justice of their cause, their own stout hearts, their noble prince, and their one ally, the ocean. Cruelty, persecution, and massacre had converted this race of peace loving workers into heroes capable of the most sublime self sacrifices. Women and children were imbued with a spirit equal to that of the men, fought as stoutly on the walls, and died as uncomplainingly from famine in the beleaguered towns. The struggle was such a long one that I have found it impossible to recount all the leading events in the space of a single volume; and, moreover, before the close, my hero, who began as a lad, would have grown into middle age, and it is an established canon in books for boys that the hero must himself be young. I have therefore terminated the story at the murder of William of Orange, and hope in another volume to continue the history, and to recount the progress of the war, when England, after years of hesitation, threw herself into the fray, and joined Holland in its struggle against the power that overshadowed all Europe, alike by its ambition and its bigotry. There has been no need to consult many authorities. Motley in his great work has exhausted the subject, and for all the historical facts I have relied solely upon him."}, {"id": "20031", "title": "A Final Reckoning A Tale of Bush Life in Australia", "genre": "Children", "language": "en", "author": "George Alfred Henty", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r3ZWAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20031/20031-h/20031-h.htm", "desc": "A Final Reckoning A Tale of Bush Life in Australia by G.

Following the destruction of the Temple, and their defeat in the second century Bar Kokhba revolt, they became a people without a home. Dispersed all over the world, their religion changed from one based on a central authority in Jerusalem, to one which was dependent on the authority of individual community-based rabbis. The destruction of Jerusalem also had a major impact on the development of Christianity. Originally Christianity took two major forms, a Jewish version and one based on the teachings of St. Paul. With the Roman destruction of Judea, and the dispersion of the Jews, the Paulinian form was the only one left standing. One can only speculate what both Christianity and Judaism would look like today if Jerusalem had not been destroyed. In For the Temple, a young Jewish boy is swept up in the events surrounding the Roman invasion. From guerrilla leader, to a defender of Jerusalem, to being a slave in Alexandria, he experiences the horror and frustration of fighting a hopeless war. He soon comes in contact with a Jewish religious group called the Essenes, who lived a reclusive life of severe self-denial. From them he hears of a Jewish teacher who was crucified only a few years earlier, and that story changes his life. The book concludes with three articles in the \"Rest of the Story\" section: I.

Built upon a few sandy islands in a shallow lagoon, and originally founded by fugitives from the mainland, Venice became one of the greatest and most respected powers of Europe. She was mistress of the sea; conquered and ruled over a considerable territory bordering on the Adriatic; checked the rising power of the Turks; conquered Constantinople; successfully defied all the attacks of her jealous rivals to shake her power; and carried on a trade relatively as great as that of England in the present day. I have laid my story in the time not of the triumphs of Venice, but of her hardest struggle for existence--when she defended herself successfully against the coalition of Hungary, Padua, and Genoa--for never at any time were the virtues of Venice, her steadfastness, her patriotism, and her willingness to make all sacrifice for her independence, more brilliantly shown. The historical portion of the story is drawn from Hazlitt's History of the Republic of Venice, and with it I have woven the adventures of an English boy, endowed with a full share of that energy and pluck which, more than any other qualities, have made the British empire the greatest the world has ever seen."}, {"id": "7061", "title": "A March on London Being a Story of Wat Tylers Insurrection", "genre": "Children", "language": "en", "author": "George Alfred Henty", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zroqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7061/7061-h/7061-h.htm", "desc": "First published in 1898, G.A.

The heavy taxation entailed by the war, the injury to trade, and the enormous prices of food, all pressed heavily upon the working classes. The invention of improved machinery, vast as has been the increase of trade which it has brought about, at first pressed heavily upon the hand workers, who assigned all their distress to the new inventions. Hence a movement arose, which did much damage and for a time threatened to be extremely formidable. It had its ramifications through all the manufacturing districts of England, the object being the destruction of the machinery, and a return to the old methods of work. The troubles which occurred in various parts of the country were known as the Luddite Riots, and the secret body which organized them was called King or General Lud. In the present story I have endeavored to give you an idea of the state of things which prevailed in Yorkshire, where, among the croppers and others employed in the woolen manufactures, was one of the most formidable branches of the secret association. The incidents of the murder of Mr. Horsfall and the attack upon Mr. Cartwright's mill are strictly accurate in all their details.In this story I have left the historical battlefields, across so many of which I have taken you, and have endeavored to show that there are peaceful battles to be fought and victories to be won every jot as arduous and as difficult as those contested under arms. In \"Facing Death\" my hero won such a battle. He had to fight against external circumstances, and step by step, by perseverance, pluck, and determination, made his way in life. In the present tale my hero's enemy was within, and although his victory was at last achieved the victor was well nigh worsted in the fray.

It was impossible, in the limits of one book, to give even an outline of the story of the Peninsular War, without devoting the whole space to the military operations. It would, in fact, have been a history rather than a tale; and it accordingly closed with the passage of the Douro, and the expulsion of the French from Portugal.The hero, Terence O'Connor, was the son of the senior captain of the Mayo Fusiliers and, when the regiment was ordered to join Sir Arthur Wellesley's expedition to Portugal, the colonel of the regiment obtained for him a commission; although so notorious was the boy, for his mischievous pranks, that the colonel hesitated whether he would not get into some serious scrapes; especially as Dick Ryan, one of the ensigns, was always his companion in mischief, and both were aided and abetted by Captain O'Grady.However, on the way out, the slow old transport, in which a wing of the regiment was carried, was attacked by two French privateers, who would have either taken or sunk her, had it not been for a happy suggestion of the quick-witted lad. For this he gained great credit, and was selected by General Fane as one of his aides-de-camp. In this capacity he went through the arduous campaign, under General Moore, that ended at Corunna.His father had been so seriously wounded, at Vimiera, that he was invalided home and placed on half pay; and in the same battle Captain O'Grady lost his left arm but, on its being cured, returned to his place in the regiment.At Corunna Terence, while carrying a despatch, was thrown from his horse and stunned; and on recovering found that the British had already embarked on board the ships of the fleet. He made his way to the frontier of Portugal, and thence to Lisbon. He was then appointed to the staff of Sir John Craddock, who was now in command; and sent in charge of some treasure for the use of the Spanish General Romana, who was collecting a force on the northern border of Portugal. Terence had orders to aid him, in any way in his power, to check the invasion of Portugal from the north.Of this order he took advantage when, on the way, the agents of the junta of Oporto endeavoured to rob him; attacking the house where he and his escort had taken up their quarters with a newly-raised levy of two thousand five hundred unarmed peasants. By a ruse he got their leaders into his hands, and these showed such abject cowardice that the peasants refused further to follow them, and asked Terence to take the command of the force.He assented, formed them into two battalions, appointed two British orderlies as majors, the Portuguese officer of his escort lieutenant-colonel, and his troopers captains of companies; put them in the way of obtaining arms and, by dint of hard drill and kindness, converted them into an efficient body of soldiers. Finding that little was to be expected from Romana's force, he acted as a partisan leader and, in this capacity, performed such valuable service that he was confirmed in the command of his force, which received the name of the Minho regiment; and he and his officers received commissions for the rank they held in the Portuguese army."}, {"id": "2805", "title": "With Lee in Virginia A Story of the American Civil War", "genre": "Children", "language": "en", "author": "George Alfred Henty", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g3ZWAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2805/2805-h/2805-h.htm", "desc": "Great classic tale of war and adventure, what every boy- girl too - needs to read!

They managed to introduce themselves one by one, and presently Mrs. Merriman was seen trotting contentedly down the avenue, followed by her new pupils. She looked something like a well-groomed pony herself, and the girls were much amused at her way of greeting them, and so thoroughly pleased that peals of laughter reached the displeased ears of Lucy, who was waiting with Annie and Laura in the porch.\"Really,\" thought Lucy, \"poor mother gets worse and worse.

I shall be glad when Miss Archer and Mademoiselle Omont come. How are we to spend the present evening?\"The girls themselves seemed to arrange that matter. Having lost all shyness with regard to Mrs. Merriman, they were not likely to feel it towards Lucy. They accordingly requested to be taken into the house, and were much pleased with the arrangements made for their comfort. The old house of Sunnyside was one of the prettiest in the southwest of England. It had spacious grounds, beautiful gardens, and the rooms themselves, although somewhat low, were large and numerous.

Raffles returns without Teddy, and lies about him to Belsize. Abruptly, Levy and Mr. Garland enter the room. Levy and Raffles do verbal battle with veiled threats. Teddy finally returns, and dismisses Levy from the house. Levy retorts that he owns the house: Mr. Garland has lost it through debt to him.Later, Levy visits Raffles and Bunny at the Albany. Levy suspects it was Raffles who stole (and then gave back) his wife's jewelry. He offers to forgive Raffles if Raffles will steal a document from an enemy lawyer. Raffles agrees to, on the additional condition that Levy forgive Mr. Garland's remaining interest payments.Next day, Raffles and Bunny watch Teddy play at Lord's. Bunny talks to Belsize, while Raffles leaves to prepare the burglary. At night, Bunny joins Raffles in the lawyer's house, where Raffles swaps Levy's document with a fake.

Written by J. S. Fletcher, one of the most prolific, leading writers of the Golden Age of detective fiction and first published in 1920, the novel still enjoys great popularity among fans of quick-paced stories that involve complicated mysteries and pure-hearted amateur investigators. The narrator of the story is a young man called Hugh Moneylaws, a clerk in the office of a lawyer called Mr. Lindsey in Berwick-Upon-Tweed, a small and quiet town on the border between England and Scotland. Hugh is on an errand that he undertakes from a mysterious lodger in his mother's boarding house in order to supplement his salary when he comes across a dead body - the first in the line of many, the story featuring a high body count. As the investigation goes on, Hugh travels to all sorts of places by train, by ship and other vehicles and gets into all sorts of dangerous situations that he manages to escape miraculously, very often with the help of his employer who is also the brains behind the entire investigation.The mystery is complicated, but also predictable to a certain extent. However, that does not make the novel less enjoyable - the plot comes with beautiful, remote places, closely-knit communities that have their own rules and laws, excellently-penned characters, principal and minor alike, lots of humorous events and adventures that will make the reader laugh out loud and a romantic story line that makes it all even more exciting."}, {"id": "9902", "title": "The Middle of Things", "genre": "Detective", "language": "en", "author": "Joseph Smith Fletcher", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PvV4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/9902/9902-h/9902-h.htm", "desc": "A man is murdered in an alley, apparently for his rings and money.

The Old Man in the Corner contains twelve of the stories by Baroness Orczy featuring the mysterious man who sits in the corner of the ABC tea shop fiddling with a piece of string whilst working our the solutions to crimes that have baffled the police. Each case is unfolded during the course of a conversation between the man in the corner and a lady journalist, an ingenious method that avoids the necessity of a clumsy tacked-on explanation of the crime. Relying solely on his vast Holmesian powers of deduction, the \"strange looking\" sleuth never deigns to visit the scene of the crime, question a suspect, or examine clues. Nor does he have much faith in conventional police methods and crime solving capabilities. _We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

It was first serialised in parts in the American journal 'The Little Review' from March 1918 to December 1920, and then published in its entirety by Sylvia Beach in February 1922, in Paris. 'Ulysses' has survived bowdlerization, legal action and bitter controversy. Capturing a single day in the life of Dubliner Leopold Bloom, his friends Buck Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus, his wife Molly, and a scintillating cast of supporting characters, Joyce pushes Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. An undisputed modernist classic, its ceaseless verbal inventiveness and astonishingly wide-ranging allusions confirm its standing as an imperishable monument to the human condition. It takes readers into the inner realms of human consciousness using the interior monologue style that came to be called stream of consciousness. In addition to this psychological characteristic, it gives a realistic portrait of the life of ordinary people living in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904. The novel was the subject of a famous obscenity trial in 1933, but was found by a U.S. district court in New York to be a work of art. The furor over the novel made Joyce a celebrity. In the long run, the work placed him at the forefront of the modern period of the early 1900s when literary works, primarily in the first two decades, explored interior lives and subjective reality in a new idiom, attempting to probe the human psyche in order to understand the human condition. This richly-allusive novel, revolutionary in its modernistic experimentalism, was hailed as a work of genius by W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot and Ernest Hemingway. Scandalously frank, wittily erudite, mercurially eloquent, resourcefully comic and generously humane, 'Ulysses' offers the reader a life-changing experience.

Frank Baum's world of Oz has become one of the most enduring and beloved creations in children's literature. It has influenced numerous prominent writers and intellectuals, and become a lasting part of the culture itself. L. Frank Baum was born in 1856 in upstate New York, the seventh child of a very successful barrel-maker and later oil producer. However, Baum's own career path was a rocky one. Beginning as an actor, Baum tried working as a traveling salesman, the editor of a small town newspaper and the publisher of a trade journal on retailing, failing to distinguish himself in any occupation. His careers either failed to provide a sufficient living for his beloved wife Maud and their children or were so exhausting as to be debilitating. In the 1890's, L. Frank Baum took the advice of his mother-in-law, suffragist leader Matilda Gage, and turned his attention to trying to sell the stories he'd been telling to his sons and their friends. After a few children's books published with varying success, he published The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1900 and it quickly became a bestseller and has remained so ever since. In this first full-length adult biography of Baum, Rogers discusses some of the aspects that made his work unique and has likely contributed to Oz's long-lasting appeal, including Baum's early support of feminism and how it was reflected in his characters, his interest in Theosophy and how it took form in his books, and the celebration in his stories of traditional American values. Grounding his imaginative creations, particularly in his fourteen Oz books, in the reality of his day, Katharine M. Rogers explores the fascinating life and influences of America's greatest writer for children."}, {"id": "19467", "title": "Little Wizard Stories of Oz", "genre": "Fantasy", "language": "en", "author": "L Frank Baum", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=motCBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19467/19467-h/19467-h.htm", "desc": "Little Wizard Stories of Oz is a set of six short stories written for young children by L. Frank Baum, the creator of the Oz books. The six tales were published in separate small booklets, Oz books in miniature, in 1913, and then in a collected edition in 1914 with illustrations by John R. Neill. Each booklet was 29 pages long, and printed in blue ink rather than black. The stories were part of a project, by Baum and his publisher Reilly & Britton, to revitalize and continue the series of Oz books that Baum had written up to that date. The story collection effectively constitutes a fifteenth Oz book by Baum. Baum had attempted to end the Oz series with the sixth book, The Emerald City of Oz (1910); in the final chapter of that book he sealed off the Land of Oz from the outside world. He began a new series of books with The Sea Fairies (1911) and Sky Island (1912). Also, he reacted to his 1911 bankruptcy by increasing his literary output: he produced five books that year, his greatest output since 1907. Baum tried to launch two other juvenile novel series in 1911, with The Daring Twins, released under his own name, and The Flying Girl, under his Edith Van Dyne pseudonym."}, {"id": "419", "title": "The Magic of Oz", "genre": "Fantasy", "language": "en", "author": "L Frank Baum", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3OAQAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/419/419-h/419-h.htm", "desc": "A young citizen of Oz who learns an important magic word falls prey to the wickedness of the Nomes"}, {"id": "16259", "title": "The Surprising Adventures of the Magical Monarch of Mo and His People", "genre": "Fantasy", "language": "en", "author": "L Frank Baum", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hm9xemlhZdEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16259/16259-h/16259-h.htm", "desc": "I dare say there are several questions you would like to ask at the very beginning of this history.

So he set forth from Narberth that night, and went as far as Llwyn Diarwyd. And that night he tarried there, and early on the morrow he rose and came to Glyn Cuch; when he let loose the dogs in the wood, and sounded the horn, and began the chace. And as he followed the dogs, he lost his companions; and whilst he listened to the hounds, he heard the cry of other hounds, a cry different from his own, and coming in the opposite direction. And he beheld a glade in the wood forming a level plain, and as his dogs came to the edge of the glade, he saw a stag before the other dogs. And lo, as it reached the middle of the glade, the dogs that followed the stag overtook it, and brought it down. Then looked he at the colour of the dogs, staying not to look at the stag, and of all the hounds that he had seen in the world, he had never seen any that were like unto those. For their hair was of a brilliant shining white, and their ears were red; and as the whiteness of their bodies shone, so did the redness of their ears glisten. And he came towards the dogs, and drove away those that had brought down the stag, and set his own dogs upon it.

In The Natural Genesis, presented here in an omnibus edition, Massey delivers a sequel, delving deeper into his compelling polemic. In Volume I, he offers a more intellectual, fine-tuned analysis of the development of society out of Egypt. From the simplest signs (numbers, the cross) to the grandest archetypes (darkness, the mother figure), Massey carefully and confidently lays the cultural and psychosocial bricks of evolutionism. Volume II provides detailed discourse on the Egyptian origin of the delicate components of the monotheistic creed. With his agile prose, Massey leads an adventurous examination of the epistemology of astronomy, time, and Christology-and what it all means for human culture. British author GERALD MASSEY (1828-1907) published works of poetry, spiritualism, Shakespearean criticism, and theology, but his best known works are in the realm of Egyptology, including The Book of the Beginnings, The Natural Genesis, and Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World."}, {"id": "5518", "title": "The Bride of the Nile \u2014 Volume 02", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Georg Ebers", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8DWgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5518/5518-h/5518-h.htm", "desc": "Description currently un available"}, {"id": "21315", "title": "The Kings Sons", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "afterwards HOFLAND HOOLE Barbara", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CW8taZWdMdkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21315/21315-h/21315-h.htm", "desc": "Description currently un available"}, {"id": "16196", "title": "King Olafs Kinsman\r A Story of the Last Saxon Struggle against the Danes in the Days of Ironside and Cnut", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Charles W Whistler", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IfLEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16196/16196-h/16196-h.htm", "desc": "\"King Olaf's Kinsman\" by Charles W.

On the same day another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him. All England wanted him too. England had so longed for him, and hoped for him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the people went nearly mad for joy. Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they kept this up for days and nights together. By day, London was a sight to see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and splendid pageants marching along. By night, it was again a sight to see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry around them. There was no talk in all England but of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him-and not caring, either. But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence.

In the reign of Richard II., when it was first established, it was styled the Painted Tavern, from the circumstance of its outer walls being fancifully coloured and adorned with Bacchanalian devices. But these decorations went out of fashion in time, and the tavern, somewhat changing its external features, though preserving all its internal comforts and accommodation, assumed the name of the Three Crowns, under which title it continued until the accession of Elizabeth, when it became (by a slight modification) the Three Cranes; and so remained in the days of her successor, and, indeed, long afterwards. Not that the last-adopted denomination had any reference, as might be supposed, to the three huge wooden instruments on the wharf, employed with ropes and pulleys to unload the lighters and other vessels that brought up butts and hogsheads of wine from the larger craft below Bridge, and constantly thronged the banks; though, no doubt, they indirectly suggested it.

Especially in his Unspoken Sermons (1867-89) he shows a highly developed theology.

Yet, all of it was written by one person. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Many people do not realize that the creator of Sherlock Holmes was also one of the best historical novelists of his day. His books span events ranging from the Hundred Years War, to the 19th Century British occupation of Egypt-and include, as in this work, the Huguenot persecutions. The year is 1690 and the De Catinat family is facing disaster. Because they are Huguenots, French Protestants, Louis XIV has stripped the family of their wealth, titles and soon, in all likelihood, their lives. They are rescued, however, by an American who is visiting Paris. He arranges for them to escape to the New World, but their troubles are just beginning. Warrants are out for their arrest and they are being hunted by a fanatical Jesuit priest who is hot on their trail. Their only hope is to leave French Canada and try to make it to the Protestant communities in New England. Unfortunately, to get there they have to make it through hundreds of miles of trackless forests, while being chased by the priest, and avoiding a band of Iroquois who would rather torture and kill a white man as look at him. As you might expect from a writer like Conan Doyle, it is an adventure that will keep you guessing right up to the last page."}, {"id": "12449", "title": "A Reputed Changeling\r Or Three Seventh Years Two Centuries Ago", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Charlotte Mary Yonge", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xzIWAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12449/12449-h/12449-h.htm", "desc": "Description currently un available"}, {"id": "2511", "title": "The History of Henry Esmond Esq a Colonel in the Service of Her Majesty Queen Anne", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "William Makepeace Thackeray", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YKcQAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2511/2511-h/2511-h.htm", "desc": "Description currently un available"}, {"id": "7624", "title": "Devereux \u2014 Volume 01", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Edward BullverLitton", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=poBnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7624/7624-h/7624-h.htm", "desc": "This volume contains the proceedings of the conference on Computer Aided V- i?cation (CAV 2002), held in Copenhagen, Denmark on July 27-31, 2002.

Though the story is set in the early 19th century, it is an allegory about the upheaval of the American Civil War and was meant to promote the Union cause. Plot summary: The protagonist is a young United States Army lieutenant, Philip Nolan, who develops a friendship with the visiting Aaron Burr. When Burr is tried for treason (historically this occurred in 1807), Nolan is tried as an accomplice. During his testimony, he bitterly renounces his nation, angrily shouting, \"I wish I may never hear of the United States again!\" The judge is completely shocked at this announcement, and on convicting him, icily grants him his wish: he is to spend the rest of his life aboard United States Navy warships, in exile, with no right ever again to set foot on U.S. soil, and with explicit orders that no one shall ever mention his country to him again. The sentence is carried out to the letter. For the rest of his life, Nolan is transported from ship to ship, living out his life as a prisoner on the high seas, never once allowed back in a home port. Though he is treated according to his former rank, nothing of his country is ever mentioned to him. None of the sailors in whose custody Nolan remains is allowed to speak to him about the U.S., and his newspapers are censored. Nolan is unrepentant at first, but over the years becomes sadder and wiser, and desperate for news. One day, as he is being transferred to another ship, he beseeches a young sailor never to make the same mistake that he had: \"Remember, boy, that behind all these men... behind officers and government, and people even, there is the Country Herself, your Country, and that you belong to her as you belong to your own mother. Stand by her, boy, as you would stand by your mother... !\" On one such ship, he attends a party in which he dances with a young lady he had formerly known. He then beseeches her to tell him something, anything, about the United States, but she quickly withdraws and speaks no longer to him. Deprived of a homeland, Nolan slowly and painfully learns the true worth of his country. He misses it more than his friends or family, more than art or music or love or nature. Without it, he is nothing. Dying aboard the USS Levant, he shows his room to an officer named Danforth; it is \"a little shrine\" of patriotism. The Stars and Stripes are draped around a picture of George Washington. Over his bed, Nolan has painted a bald eagle, with lightning \"blazing from his beak\" and claws grasping the globe. At the foot of his bed is an outdated map of the United States, showing many of its old territories that had, unbeknownst to him, been admitted to statehood. Nolan smiles, \"Here, you see, I have a country!\" The dying man asks desperately to be told the news of American history since 1807, and Danforth finally relates to him almost all of the major events that have happened to the U.S. since his sentence was imposed; the narrator confesses, however, that \"I could not make up my mouth to tell him a word about this infernal rebellion.\" Nolan then asks him to bring his copy of the Presbyterian Book of Public Prayer, and read the page where it will automatically open. These are the words: \"Most heartily we beseech Thee with Thy favor to behold and bless Thy servant, the President of the United States, and all others in authority.\" Nolan says: \"I have repeated those prayers night and morning, it is now fifty-five years.\" ..."}, {"id": "1644", "title": "The Adventures of Gerard", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Jules G\u00e9rard", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MwYFAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1644/1644-h/1644-h.htm", "desc": "Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventures of Gerard (1903) is an anthology of short stories about the heroics of a Hussar of the French army who lived from the 1780s to 1860s.

Prince was born in Bermuda to an enslaved family. She spent her early life in harsh conditions and was eventually sold to John Adams Wood of Antigua, working as his domestic servant. She joined the Moravian Church, where she learned to read, and married Daniel James, a former slave who had bought his freedom. In 1828 she traveled to England with the Woods family and after protracted efforts by abolitionists was able to leave their control. Encouraged by her new employer, Thomas Pringle, who also served as her editor, Prince wrote and published her book in 1831 to wide acclaim. While eighteenth-century slave narratives largely focused on Christian spiritual journeys and religious redemption, Prince was part of a growing trend of abolitionist writers focused on the injustice of slavery. Her work stands alongside better-known narratives such as A Narrative of the Adventures and Escape of Moses Roper and Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. Adding to its importance, few early women's slave narratives exist. A DOCSOUTH BOOK.

It is a towering dome of green among a hundred pinnacles of grey and rust-red crags. At dawn the summit of the mountain has an eagle eye for the far Venetian boundary and the barrier of the Apennines; but with sunrise come the mists. The vast brown level is seen narrowing in; the Ticino and the Sesia waters, nearest, quiver on the air like sleepy lakes; the plain is engulphed up to the high ridges of the distant Southern mountain range, which lie stretched to a faint cloud-like line, in shape like a solitary monster of old seas crossing the Deluge. Long arms of vapour stretch across the urn-like valleys, and gradually thickening and swelling upward, enwrap the scored bodies of the ashen-faced peaks and the pastures of the green mountain, till the heights become islands over a forgotten earth. Bells of herds down the hidden run of the sweet grasses, and a continuous leaping of its rivulets, give the Motterone a voice of youth and homeliness amid that stern company of Titan-heads, for whom the hawk and the vulture cry. The storm has beaten at them until they have got the aspect of the storm. They take colour from sunlight, and are joyless in colour as in shade. When the lower world is under pushing steam, they wear the look of the revolted sons of Time, fast chained before scornful heaven in an iron peace. Day at last brings vigorous fire; arrows of light pierce the mist-wreaths, the dancing draperies, the floors of vapour; and the mountain of piled pasturages is seen with its foot on the shore of Lago Maggiore. Down an extreme gulf the full sunlight, as if darting on a jewel in the deeps, seizes the blue-green lake with its isles. The villages along the darkly-wooded borders of the lake show white as clustered swans; here and there a tented boat is visible, shooting from terraces of vines, or hanging on its shadow. Monte Boscero is unveiled; the semicircle of the Piedmontese and the Swiss peaks, covering Lake Orta, behind, on along the Ticinese and the Grisons, leftward toward and beyond the Lugano hills, stand bare in black and grey and rust-red and purple. You behold a burnished realm of mountain and plain beneath the royal sun of Italy. In the foreground it shines hard as the lines of an irradiated Cellini shield. Farther away, over middle ranges that are soft and clear, it melts, confusing the waters with hot rays, and the forests with darkness, to where, wavering in and out of view like flying wings, and shadowed like wings of archangels with rose and with orange and with violet, silverwhite Alps are seen. You might take them for mystical streaming torches on the border-ground between vision and fancy. They lean as in a great flight forward upon Lombardy."}, {"id": "73", "title": "The Red Badge of Courage An Episode of the American Civil War", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Stephen Crane", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qcMvAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/73/73-h/73-h.htm", "desc": "Description currently un available"}, {"id": "7739", "title": "The Parisians \u2014 Volume 03", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "\u0412\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9aM3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7739/7739-h/7739-h.htm", "desc": "Description currently un available"}, {"id": "7742", "title": "The Parisians \u2014 Volume 06", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Giacomo Casanova", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OvllDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7742/7742-h/7742-h.htm", "desc": "Description currently un available"}, {"id": "7743", "title": "The Parisians \u2014 Volume 07", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Edward BullverLitton", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zZ5oDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7743/7743-h/7743-h.htm", "desc": "Description currently un available"}, {"id": "7748", "title": "The Parisians \u2014 Volume 12", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Cather Studies", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=84i5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7748/7748-h/7748-h.htm", "desc": "Over the five decades of her writing career Willa Cather responded to, and entered into dialogue with, shifts in the terrain of American life. These cultural encounters informed her work as much as the historical past in which much of her writing is based. Cather was a multifaceted cultural critic, immersing herself in the arts, broadly defined: theater and opera, art, narrative, craft production. Willa Cather and the Arts shows that Cather repeatedly engaged with multiple forms of art, and that even when writing about the past she was often addressing contemporary questions. The essays in this volume are informed by new modes of contextualization, including the increasingly popular view of Cather as a pivotal or transitional figure working between and across very different cultural periods and by the recent publication of Cather\u2019s correspondence. The collection begins by exploring the ways Cather encountered and represented high and low cultures, including Cather\u2019s use of \u201cracialized vernacular\u201d in Sapphira and the Slave Girl. The next set of essays demonstrates how historical research, often focusing on local features in Cather\u2019s fiction, contributes to our understanding of American culture, from musicological sources to the cultural development of Pittsburgh. The final trio of essays highlights current Cather scholarship, including a food studies approach to O Pioneers! and an examination of Cather\u2019s use of ancient philosophy in The Professor\u2019s House. Together the essays reassess Cather\u2019s lifelong encounter with, and interpretation and reimagining of, the arts."}, {"id": "7749", "title": "The Parisians \u2014 Complete", "genre": "Historical", "language": "en", "author": "Edward BullverLitton", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m59oDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7749/7749-h/7749-h.htm", "desc": "\"The Parisians \u2014 Complete\" by Baron Edward Bulwer Lytton Lytton.

Their way was unobstructed until they approached London Bridge; then they ploughed into the multitude again, Hendon keeping a fast grip upon the Prince's-no, the King's-wrist. The tremendous news was already abroad, and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once-\"The King is dead!\" The tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little waif, and sent a shudder through his frame. He realised the greatness of his loss, and was filled with a bitter grief; for the grim tyrant who had been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him. The tears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects. For an instant he felt himself the most forlorn, outcast, and forsaken of God's creatures-then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching thunders: \"Long live King Edward the Sixth!\" and this made his eyes kindle, and thrilled him with pride to his fingers' ends. \"Ah,\" he thought, \"how grand and strange it seems-I AM KING!\" We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

Meade Falkner, is a short novel of ghosts and the evil that can be invested in an object, in this case an extremely fine Stradivarius violin. After finding the violin of the title in a hidden compartment in his college rooms, the protagonist, a wealthy young heir, becomes increasingly secretive as well as obsessed by a particular piece of music, which seems to have the power to call up the ghost of its previous owner. Roaming from England to Italy, the story involves family love, lordly depravity, and the tragedy of obsession, all conveyed in a \"high\" serious tone not uncommon in late Victorian literature. Preceding M.R. James's ghost stories by several years, it has been called the novel James might have written, had he written novels. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work.

This volume reproduces at full size the first-edition bilingual publication of Le Corbeau / The Raven (Richard Lesclide, Paris, 1875), Mallarm\u00e9's prose translation of Poe's melancholy poem, including six commissioned illustrations by \u00c9douard Manet--four that visually interpret specific stanzas of the poem, one that serves as the ex-libris and a cover image of a raven's head that functions as the poem's title. In addition, a new retranslation back into English of Mallarm\u00e9's text, which was both praised and criticized for its literalism, reveals the particular tenor and subtleties of his reading of Poe's verse and his feel, as a fellow poet, for the emotive and evocative power of language. The result is a circular exploration of the poem and its translation. The volume also reflects Mallarm\u00e9's specifications for layout, typeface and paper. This is the second in a series exploring Mallarm\u00e9 in translation. The first, A Blow of Dice Never Will Abolish Chance, appeared in 2018; forthcoming is a translation of the second published collaboration between Mallarm\u00e9 and Manet, Afternoon of a Faun (L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune)."}, {"id": "14833", "title": "Varney the Vampire Or the Feast of Blood", "genre": "Horror", "language": "en", "author": "Thomas Preskett Prest", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FN2nDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14833/14833-h/14833-h.htm", "desc": "First published in the year 1847, famous Victorian writer Thomas Preskett Prest's longish gothic story 'Varney the Vampire; Or, the Feast of Blood' was serialized as weekly cheap pamphlets of the kind then known as \"penny dreadfuls\"."}, {"id": "43", "title": "The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde", "genre": "Horror", "language": "en", "author": "Robert Louis Stevenson", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CgQUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43/43-h/43-h.htm", "desc": "This dark psychological fantasy is more than a moral tale.

It was her habit to refresh her mind and improve her health by a daily drive between the hours of two and four in the afternoon. The world knows little of its greatest women, and it is possible that Mrs. Porter's name is not familiar to you. If this is the case, I am pained, but not surprised. It happens only too often that the uplifter of the public mind is baulked by a disinclination on the part of the public mind to meet him or her half-way. The uplifter does his share. He produces the uplifting book. But the public, instead of standing still to be uplifted, wanders off to browse on coloured supplements and magazine stories. If you are ignorant of Lora Delane Porter's books that is your affair. Perhaps you are more to be pitied than censured. Nature probably gave you the wrong shape of forehead. Mrs. Porter herself would have put it down to some atavistic tendency or pre-natal influence. She put most things down to that. She blamed nearly all the defects of the modern world, from weak intellects to in-growing toe-nails, on long-dead ladies and gentlemen who, safe in the family vault, imagined that they had established their alibi. She subpoenaed grandfathers and even great-grandfathers to give evidence to show that the reason Twentieth-Century Willie squinted or had to spend his winters in Arizona was their own shocking health 'way back in the days beyond recall."}, {"id": "6683", "title": "The Little Nugget", "genre": "Humor", "language": "en", "author": "P G Wodehouse", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lOTcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6683/6683-h/6683-h.htm", "desc": "A comic crime caper from the popular and prolific twentieth-century author of the Jeeves novels featuring Bertie Wooster.

Today, with the negative effects of \"toxic masculinity\" and aggressive behavior in evidence all around us, we need highly sensitive people--especially men--more than ever. Yet for men in particular, being highly sensitive brings distinct challenges, such as gender stereotypes that portray them as too emotional or not \"manly\" enough. Cognitive behavioral psychotherapist Tom Falkenstein offers the first psychological guide that specifically addresses highly sensitive men and those who care about them, and explores the unique advantages and obstacles they face. Drawing from his training with pioneer in the field Dr. Elaine Aron, and his own groundbreaking work, Falkenstein incorporates the most up-to-date research on high sensitivity--what it is and isn't--how it relates to male identity, and provides one-of-a-kind advice and practical tools, including: \u00b7 Self-assessment tests to measure high sensitivity \u00b7 Strategies to cope with overstimulation and intense emotions \u00b7 Exercises that enhance relaxation, mindfulness, and acceptance \u00b7 Advice on self-care and self-compassion \u00b7 Techniques to deal with situations that highly sensitive people often find difficult \u00b7 Interviews with men who have learned to live well with high sensitivity \u00b7 Insights into the key role that highly sensitive men have to play in today's world Including an illuminating conversation with Dr. Aron, The Highly Sensitive Man is an invaluable book that will help redefine masculinity and reveal how high sensitivity can enrich men's lives, their communities, and the lives of those who love them."}, {"id": "29542", "title": "The Valor of Cappen Varra", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Poul Anderson", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_RIuDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29542/29542-h/29542-h.htm", "desc": "We have said that there are many and strange shadows, memories surviving from dim pasts, in this FANTASTIC UNIVERSE of ours.

On the contrary, with the novel being written in the style of a memoirs, Jones is almost too humble about himself and the credibility of his story. The defining characteristic of the Martian civilization is that they are such an ancient, lethargic race that marriages are decided by public draw and assented to by an attitude just above apathy. Jones is an oddity not merely because of his strange dress and manner, but because of his passion for the princess. Contagious, it spreads to her and she is willing to risk her own life to provide Jones a means of identifying her ballot in the jar. Just when it seems his goal of bedding his mistress is reached, she is snatched away by the invading barbarians from afar. Furious, Jones tries to frenzy an army to no avail. The men of Mars are too cowardly, comfortable and indifferent. The only one who isn't is the prince, who sold off the princess out of jealously, the opposite of Jones' wholesome and manly red blood. Making his way by land and sea, Jones tours the Martian environs and befriends its people. Once or twice he even catches himself feeling more sympathy for the brutish, hairy barbarians than for the weak and waifish native peoples of his princess. Still he presses onwards to win her back to her people and his breast. Nevermind, of course, that he does have a girl back home that he was engaged to before the magic carpet spirited him away. She does come to mind occasionally whenever he fears that he will meet his end on this faraway world. He wonders what has become of her and what she must be feeling at this moment, but the wondering passes when he concentrates again on his quest to find his girl in this port."}, {"id": "29618", "title": "The Aggravation of Elmer", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Robert Andrew Arthur", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3m_TCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29618/29618-h/29618-h.htm", "desc": "Published in 1955, this remarkably prescient short story from speculative-fiction master Robert Andrew Arthur tackles the possibility of global warming decades before the issue made its way into the headlines.

Still, we perservere, because no matter what else happens this week, you can be sure that someone, somewhere, will win the big one. Lotteries are an unparalleled popular phenomenon. But what happens after the winners are revealed, and the checks have been issued? How does winning a lottery change one's life? Luck of the Draw profiles past winners of big lotteries, and how their windfall impacted their lives, mostly for the better, but interestingly sometimes for the worse, such was the case of a Florida widow who won $5 million in 1984; three years later, she lost her mansion and fancy cars, and owed the IRS $500,000 for back taxes. Eventually she was arrested for trying to hire a contract killer to take out her daughter-in-law, whom she blamed for her lottery misfortune. The book also depicts the past, present and future of lotteries in North America and the world over, and includes a special chapter on the revived phenomenon of big-time TV game show winners. Who wants to be a millionaire? Seemingly, everyone. In a country where eighty percent of adults have played a lottery, creating a multi-billion dollar industry, Luck of the Draw is an insightful inside look at lotteries, its winners, and its losers."}, {"id": "32360", "title": "The Holes Around Mars", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Jerome Bixby", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GgRslQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32360/32360-h/32360-h.htm", "desc": "Spaceship crews should be selected on the basis of their non-irritating qualities as individuals.

For decades the Magistrate has been a loyal servant of the Empire, running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement and ignoring the impending war with the barbarians. When interrogation experts arrive, however, he witnesses the Empire's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war. Jolted into sympathy for their victims, he commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state. J. M. Coetzee's prize-winning novel is a startling allegory of the war between opressor and opressed. The Magistrate is not simply a man living through a crisis of conscience in an obscure place in remote times; his situation is that of all men living in unbearable complicity with regimes that ignore justice and decency.

Employing innovative computer-linguistic methods, it examines the dynamics of this debate across Europe and compares it to that of the United States. In doing so, it argues that transnational political communication has shaped European identity-formation in significant ways and that, in trying to come to terms with important crises and institutional events, shared understandings of Europe have emerged. Looking at evidence from a wide range of countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and spanning a continuous period of 16 years, this book empirically analyses these shared understandings of the EU as a problem-solving and ethical community.

This strategy holds the attention of readers who would otherwise reject the subject matter. Fulmer traces the line of descent from Mary Lavin to \u00c9il\u00eds N\u00ed Dhuibhne and from Zora Neale Hurston to Toni Morrison, showing how obstacles to free expression, though varying from those Lavin and Hurston faced, are still encountered by Morrison and N\u00ed Dhuibhne. The basis for comparing these authors lies in the strategies of indirection they use, as influenced by folklore. The folkloric characters these authors depict-wild denizens of the Otherworld and wise women of various traditions-help their creators insert controversy into fiction in ways that charm rather than alienate readers. Forms of rhetorical indirection that appear in the context of folklore, such as signifying practices, masking, sly civility, and the grotesque or bizarre, come out of the mouths and actions of these writers' magical and magisterial characters. Old traditions can offer new ways of discussing issues such as sexual expression, religious beliefs, or issues of reproduction. As differences between times and cultures affect what \"can\" and \"cannot\" be said, folkloric indirection may open up a vista to discourses of which we as readers may not even be aware. Finally, the folk women of Morrison, N\u00ed Dhuibhne, Hurston, and Lavin open up new points of entry to the discussion of fiction, rhetoric, censorship, and folklore"}, {"id": "51533", "title": "The Celestial Hammerlock", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Fritz Leiber", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4gt5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51533/51533-h/51533-h.htm", "desc": "The Science Fiction Archive #2, an amazing collection of the greatest science fiction writing EVER!

But Camille is determined to have a life free from his strings. Out on her own, she's made mistakes, including one that found her clawing her way back after a stint in rehab and plenty of bad press. Now, after fighting so hard to be independent and happy, she finds her life threatened as a result of her father's ruthless business dealings. Caught between resentment and fear, Camille prepares herself for the measures her father will take to protect her. But nothing could prepare her for the ex-SAS sniper who crashes into her life. Jake Sharp resides in his own personal hell. He was distracted from duty once before, and the consequences were devastating--both personally and professionally. He vowed never to let that happen again. Accepting the job of bodyguard to Camille Logan isn't the kind of distraction from his demons he should take. Women and Jake don't mix well, yet protecting the heiress seems the lesser of two evils. But Jake soon discovers that she isn't the woman she's perceived to be. She's warm, compassionate, her presence settling, and his duty to protect her soon goes deeper than a well-paid job, no matter how hard he fights it. He needs absolution. He comes to need Camille.

So she sat down and asked herself what she truly wanted. A decent guy. A nicer home. More protein. When she took a closer look at her wants, she noticed something that seemed very familiar -- with the addition of exclamation points, her list could easily be transformed into the cover lines on every women's magazine: Find the love you deserve!

About a yard in height and three and a half in diameter, it squatted in the grassy grove next the clump of trees like an enormous, inverted soup plate. Here and there tufts of grass waved on it, of a richer, deeper color, testifying to the unwholesome fertility of the crumbling outer stuff that had flaked from the solid mound walls. Like an excrescence on the flank of Mother Earth herself, the mound loomed; like an unhealthy, cancerous growth. And inside the enigmatic thing was another world. A dark world, mysterious, horrible, peopled by blind and terrible demons--a world like a Dante's dream of a second Inferno. Such, at least, were the thoughts of Dennis Braymer as he worked with delicate care at the task of sawing into the hard cement of a portion of the wall near the rounded top.

To him, obviously, this was a task of vital importance; a task worthy of all a man's ability of brain and logic. Obviously also, his companion thought of the work as just something with which to fill an idle afternoon. He puffed at a pipe, and regarded the entomologist with a smile."}, {"id": "22754", "title": "Masters of Space", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Walter Kellogg Towers", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ZQ3AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22754/22754-h/22754-h.htm", "desc": "This book features several chapters on the life and work of Alexander Graham Bell including a chapter devoted to the debut of the telephone at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876."}, {"id": "21582", "title": "The Mightiest Man", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Patrick Fahy", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yfWZDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21582/21582-h/21582-h.htm", "desc": "He had betrayed mankind, but he was not afraid of the consequences--ever!"}, {"id": "32162", "title": "The Beasts in the Void", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Paul W Fairman", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NRouDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32162/32162-h/32162-h.htm", "desc": "Holloway was used to big game hunters and their expeditions to other worlds.

What did so many creative minds find in scripture? Is the Bible still a vital source of poetic inspirations? Chapters Into Verse is the first comprehensive collection ever made of poems written in English inspired by the Bible. A groundbreaking anthology, it introduces readers to a distinct heritage of English poetry: the scriptural tradition. Though frequently ignored and sometimes suppressed, this tradition rivals the classical and is every bit as venerable. Drawing a unique map of the history of English poetry, the two volumes of Chapters Into Verse survey and define the literary legacy of the Scriptures from the fourteenth century to the present. Each volume is arranged in scriptural order, and each poem is preceded by the biblical passage that inspired it. Thus readers can conveniently witness the various ways sacred text has sparked the imagination of poets throughout the ages. In Volume I, which covers Genesis to Malachi, almost every book of the Old Testament is represented. The collection features verses both famous and unfamiliar, from Milton's Paradise Lost and Lord Byron's Hebrew Melodies to Christopher Smart's hymns and Mary Herbert's psalms. The editors have included poems by virtually all the prominent religious poets--among them, John Donne, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Edward Taylor, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Included, too, are devotional and visionary works from a wide range of vintage poets--Robert Burns, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Christina Rossetti, Alfred Tennyson, and Robert Browning. Proving that the Bible is just as powerful a source of inspiration today as it was in the past, the collection assembles a mixed congregation of modern and contemporary poets, such as Marianne Moore, Delmore Schwartz, Dylan Thomas, Robert Frost, William Carlos Williams, Countee Cullen, e.e. cummings, William Butler Yeats, Robert Lowell, Hugh McDiarmid, Laura (Riding) Jackson, Charles Reznikoff, A.D. Hope, Geoffrey Hill, Denise Levertov, Philip Levine, John Ashbery, and Derek Walcott. Of enduring interest to readers of both scripture and literature, this anthology illuminates key passages of the Old Testament. The measured speech and inspired leaps of poetry offer a spirited alternative to the textual exegesis usually supplied by prose commentary. As such, Chapters Into Verse is truly a poets' Bible. In selection after selection, readers will encounter an astonishing variety of religious experiences, as a host of poets from many eras and many backgrounds respond to Holy Scripture spiritually, profoundly, and imaginatively."}, {"id": "24005", "title": "But I Dont Think", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Randall Garrett", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IydsCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24005/24005-h/24005-h.htm", "desc": "I The great merchantship Naipor settled her tens of thousands of tons of mass into her landing cradle on Viornis as gently as an egg being settled into an egg crate, and almost as silently.

With Bruce Chatwin's Utz and Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the novel was short-listed for Britain's prestigious Whitbread Prize. Now, with scathing wit and enthralling vision, the author whom the Washington Post has praised as \"one of the most exciting discoveries in the contemporary English novel [in] 40 or so years\" returns to a city transformed and transforming, and in peril of its life. These are the times and trials of Dennis Dover, former rock guitarist, photojournalist, and paparazzo. Denny inhabits a world of vibrant color, smell, and sound, where novel experience and unpredictability are anchored by steadfast tradition and history. Mother London's many vagaries give Denny Dover joy and succor, always seducing him home from the Earth's terrible places, where the face of death is as common as the blood that stains the local dirt. And London is where Rosie Beck is, when she isn't off elsewhere combating the planet's great ills. Denny's brilliant, beautiful, socially conscious cousin has always been an indispensable part of his being -- his soul mate and his soul. Since childhood they have been inseparable, delighting in the daily discoveries of a life with no limits. But now the metropolis that nurtured them is threatened by a powerful, unstoppable force that consumes the past indiscriminately and leaves nothing of substance in its wake. The terminator is named John Barbican Begg. A hanger-on from Denny and Rosie's youth, he has become the morally corrupt center of their London and the richest, most rapacious creature in the Western Hemisphere. Now, as their cherished landmarks tumble, conspiracy, secrets, lies, and betrayal become the centerpieces of Rosie and Dennis's days. For Barbican has but one goal: to devour the entire world. And the only choice left is to join in, drop out ... or plot to destroy. A sprawling work of incomparable invention, King of the City is eccentric and remarkable, a unique urban love story with a pit-bull bite that confirms the unparalleled literary genius of the amazing Michael Moorcock."}, {"id": "51712", "title": "A Trace of Memory", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Keith Laumer", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CIigDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51712/51712-h/51712-h.htm", "desc": "He awoke and lay for a moment looking up at a low ceiling, dimly visible in a faint red glow, feeling the hard mat under his back.

The victims were not political opponents but friends, colleagues and fellow fascists who had helped the Nazi Party in its rise to power. The Night of the Long Knives broke the back and the will of the Sturmabteilung, the SA, the brawling street thugs who had bludgeoned political opposition into submission. The SA's ruthless bullyboy tactics played no small part in Hitler's establishment of a dictatorship that was to influence affairs in Germany - and the world - throughout the 1930s and beyond. In some respects the purge was inevitable. Hitler had to eliminate all potential rivals if he was to consolidate his position of power. And that meant that friends like Ernst R\u00f6hm, former German Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher, and even former party comrades like Gregor Strasser were summarily shot without trial. Above all it was the SA that the army, the industrialists and, more than anyone else, Adolf Hitler feared. R\u00f6hm enjoyed a popularity that almost rivaled Hitler's and so he had to go. It was also an opportunity to settle personal scores. The Night of the Long Knives was a cull that eliminated somewhere between 300 and a thousand victims, the exact number has never been clear, many of them innocent of any intention to rival Hitler. It remains one of the most significant killings of modern times."}, {"id": "23439", "title": "Attention Saint Patrick", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Murray Leinster", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HgDYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23439/23439-h/23439-h.htm", "desc": "\"Attention Saint Patrick\" by Murray Leinster.

The idea of a continuous shared Japanese culture, often described as \"Japanese-ness,\" is epitomized by material items ranging from Zen Buddhist stone gardens and tea ceremony equipment to such archaeological artifacts as the prehistoric Jomon clay figurines. An Archaeological History of Japan challenges this notion by critically examining archaeological evidence as well as the way it has been interpreted. By combining techniques of traditional archaeological investigation with the tools of contemporary critical sociological and anthropological theory, An Archaeological History of Japan reveals the contingent, reflexive nature of how the prehistoric inhabitants of the Japanese islands identified themselves as they mapped their social and cultural environment. Koji Mizoguchi demonstrates that this process of self-identification underwent transformations as societies and technology changed, indicating that there is no intrinsic connection binding present-day Japanese with people of the past."}, {"id": "29326", "title": "The Great Drought", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Capt Sp Meek", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RfVj3xdLQIoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29326/29326-h/29326-h.htm", "desc": "Another episode in Dr. Bird's extraordinary duel with the scientific wizard Saranoff."}, {"id": "28550", "title": "Song in a Minor Key", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "C L Moore", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-9B66rMT3cgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28550/28550-h/28550-h.htm", "desc": "Description currently un available"}, {"id": "29897", "title": "Runaway", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Wendelin Van Draanen", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T6M5QKeXHSMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29897/29897-h/29897-h.htm", "desc": "After running away from her fifth foster home, Holly, a twelve-year-old orphan, travels across the country, keeping a journal of her experiences and struggle to survive."}, {"id": "26882", "title": "Omega the Man", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Lowell Howard Morrow", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lP-aDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26882/26882-h/26882-h.htm", "desc": "Lowell Howard Morrow, probably best known for his science fiction story \"Omega, the Man\", was a noted American author."}, {"id": "33642", "title": "Earth Alert", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Anthony Sailer", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=olXeAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33642/33642-h/33642-h.htm", "desc": "All is quiet on Earth as everything appears normal.

Most scholarly work on the subject has been confined either to tracking down representations of legal practices in texts or to examining formal questions relating to legal discourse. In a groundbreaking departure, The Letter of the Law suggests that law and literature should be understood as parallel forms of discourse -- at times complementary, at times antagonistic, but always mutually illuminating. Emily Steiner and Candace Barrington maintain that medievalists are uniquely placed to make valuable new contributions to the subject of law and literature, in part because of the inherently interdisciplinary nature of the study of medieval law, inseparable as it was from political theory and theology. Treating texts as varied as Chaucer's Knight's Tale, the fifteenth-century Robin Hood ballads, and William Thorpe's account of his own heresy trial, the nine never-before-published essays in this volume reveal the intersections of legal and documentary culture with vernacular literary production. They establish that law and English literature were intimately bound up in processes of institutional, linguistic, and social change, and they explain how the specific conditions of medieval law and literature offer useful models in studying later periods.

Living in cooperative gangs and hiding in the forests from the Hans, Americans secretly rebuild their civilization and develop the new technologies, and only now, four centuries later, begin to rebel. The main character, Anthony 'Buck' Rogers, was a veteran of the Great War and in 1927 he worked for the American Radioactive Gas Corporation. Exposed to radioactive gas, Rogers fell into a coma and remained in \"sleep\" for 492 years. He awakens in 2419 and, thinking he has been asleep for just several hours, wanders for a few days in unfamiliar forests. Introduced to the new world, Rogers becomes the leader of the American rebellion. \"The Airlords of Han\" \u2013 In the sequel to Armageddon 2419 A.D and the 'Buck' Rogers story, the hero and his beloved Wilma continue their war against the diabolical Han and technologically advanced Mongolians. Rogers gets captured by the Han and gets taken to their capital, where he serves as prisoner, but gets the treatment of a royal guest. Rogers exploits these circumstances to stick a knife in the heart of the enemy."}, {"id": "24121", "title": "As Long As You Wish", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Quotes YOU", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ORQmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24121/24121-h/24121-h.htm", "desc": "JUST FOR YOU CLEAN SPIRIT!

The United States was, of course, involved, but only through McFate's employer, the military contractor DynCorp International. Throughout the world, similar scenarios are playing out daily. The United States can no longer go to war without contractors. Yet we don't know much about the industry's structure, its operations, or where it's heading. Typically led by ex-military men, contractor firms are by their very nature secretive. Even the U.S. government-the entity that actually pays them-knows relatively little. In The Modern Mercenary, Sean McFate lays bare this opaque world, explaining the economic structure of the industry and showing in detail how firms operate on the ground. A former U.S. Army paratrooper and private military contractor, McFate provides an unparalleled perspective into the nuts and bolts of the industry, as well as a sobering prognosis for the future of war. While at present, the U.S. government and U.S. firms dominate the market, private military companies are emerging from other countries, and warlords and militias have restyled themselves as private security companies in places like Afghanistan and Somalia. To understand how the proliferation of private forces may influence international relations, McFate looks back to the European Middle Ages, when mercenaries were common and contract warfare the norm. He concludes that international relations in the twenty-first century may have more in common with the twelfth century than the twentieth. This \"back to the future\" situation, which he calls \"neomedievalism,\" is not necessarily a negative condition, but it will produce a global system that contains rather than solves problems. The Modern Mercenary is the first work that combines a broad-ranging theory of the phenomenon with an insider's understanding of what the world of the private military industry is actually like."}, {"id": "40954", "title": "Potential Enemy", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Wesley K Wark", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=57lcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40954/40954-h/40954-h.htm", "desc": "How realistically did the British government assess the threat from Nazi Germany during the 1930s?

This book, the product of exhaustive archival research, first looks at the goals of British intelligence in the 1930s. He explains the various views of German power held by the principal Whitehall authorities\u2014including the various military intelligence directorates and the semi-clandestine Industrial Intelligence Centre\u2014and he describes the efforts of senior officials to fit their perceptions of German power into the framework of British military and diplomatic policy. Identifying the four phases through which the British intelligence effort evolved, he assesses its shortcomings and successes, and he calls into question the underlying premises of British intelligence doctrine. Wark shows that faulty intelligence assessments were crucial in shaping the British policy of appeasement up to the outbreak of World War II.

The incident at Waco, the subway bombing by the Japanese cult Aum Supreme Truth, and the tragedy at Jonestown are just a few examples of such apocalyptic scenarios. And these are not isolated incidents; millions of Americans today believe the end of the world is inevitable, either by a divinely ordained plan, nuclear catastrophe, extraterrestrial invasion, or gradual environmental decay, Examining the doomsday scenarios and apocalyptic predictions of visionaries, televangelists, survivalists, and various other endtimes enthusiasts, as well as popular culture, film, music, fashion, and humor, Daniel Wojcik sheds new light on America's fascination with worldly destruction and transformation. He explores the origins of contemporary apocalyptic beliefs and compares religious and secular apocalyptic speculation, showing us the routes our belief systems have traveled over the centuries to arrive at the dawn of a new millennium. Included in his sweeping examination are premillennial prophecy traditions, prophecies associated with visions of the Virgin Mary, secular ideas about nuclear apocalypse, the transformation of apocalyptic prophecy in the post-Cold War era, and emerging apocalyptic ideas associated with UFOs and extraterrestrials.

A furious Pope Innocent III accused heretics of the crime and called upon all Christians to exterminate heresy between the Garonne and Rhone rivers--a vast region now known as Languedoc--in a great crusade. This most holy war, the first in which Christians were promised salvation for killing other Christians, lasted twenty bloody years--it was a long savage battle for the soul of Christendom. In A Most Holy War, historian Mark Pegg has produced a swift-moving, gripping narrative of this horrific crusade, drawing in part on thousands of testimonies collected by inquisitors in the years 1235 to 1245. These accounts of ordinary men and women, remembering what it was like to live through such brutal times, bring the story vividly to life. Pegg argues that generations of historians (and novelists) have misunderstood the crusade; they assumed it was a war against the Cathars, the most famous heretics of the Middle Ages. The Cathars, Pegg reveals, never existed. He further shows how a millennial fervor about \"cleansing\" the world of heresy, coupled with a fear that Christendom was being eaten away from within by heretics who looked no different than other Christians, made the battles, sieges, and massacres of the crusade almost apocalyptic in their cruel intensity. In responding to this fear with a holy genocidal war, Innocent III fundamentally changed how Western civilization dealt with individuals accused of corrupting society. This fundamental change, Pegg argues, led directly to the creation of the inquisition, the rise of an anti-Semitism dedicated to the violent elimination of Jews, and even the holy violence of the Reconquista in Spain and in the New World in the fifteenth century. All derive their divinely sanctioned slaughter from the Albigensian Crusade. Haunting and immersive, A Most Holy War opens an important new perspective on a truly pivotal moment in world history, a first and distant foreshadowing of the genocide and holy violence in the modern world."}, {"id": "33854", "title": "Ask a Foolish Question", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Robert Sheckley", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VmUPDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33854/33854-h/33854-h.htm", "desc": "It's well established now that the way you put a question often determines not only the answer you'll get, but the type of answer possible.

His resignation speech against that war prompted the first standing ovation in the history of the House and marked the end of the ministerial career of one of Labour's most brilliant politicians. His arguments against that war are of profound interest and importance to American readers. For the two years prior to his resignation, Robin Cook kept a diary, a personal record of Labour's second term, that forms the core of this narrative. The Point of Departure is Robin Cook's unvarnished account of this dramatic period in British political history. Though surprised by his abrupt dismissal in 2001 as Foreign Secretary, he became determined to effect the changes in Parliamentary democracy that he believed were essential if Parliament was to move into the twenty-first century. As Tony Blair told Cook on offering him leadership of the House of Commons, \"This is the job for you.\" Drawing on firsthand experiences in the Commons and the Cabinet, of encounters in conferences and corridors and late-night conversations, Cook details his gathering disillusionment with Tony Blair's change of direction, which he believes to be profoundly mistaken, and, above all, the change in foreign policy that led the United Kingdom away from its destiny in Europe and into participation in President Bush's war in Iraq. This is the inside story of a government in power -- and of the tensions between those who govern. But above all it is the story of a politician who genuinely wanted to bring democracy closer to the people, but who saw a government increasingly detached from the values of himself and his party, and who developed a growing conviction that the government position on Iraq was morally, diplomatically, and politically wrong."}, {"id": "25035", "title": "The Happy Unfortunate", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Robert Silverberg", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EGAStvLZp5kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25035/25035-h/25035-h.htm", "desc": "Dekker, back from space, found great physical changes in the people of Earth; changes that would have horrified him five years before.

He didn't even look at the card that the test machine dropped into his hand until he was almost to the portway. And then he stopped. \"Report to Room 33 for reclassification,\" it said. Ten years before, Clarey would have been ecstatic, sure that reclassification could be only in one direction. The machine had not originally given him a job commensurate with his talents; why should it suddenly recognize them? He'd known of people who had been reclassified-always downward. I'm a perfectly competent Sub-Archivist, he told himself; I'll fight. But he knew fighting wouldn't help. All he had was the right to refuse any job he could claim was not in his line; the government would then be obligated to continue his existence. There were many people who did subsist on the government dole: the aged and the deficient and the defective-and creative artists who refused to trammel their spirits and chose to be ranked as Unemployables. Clarey didn't fit into those categories. Dispiritedly, he passed along innumerable winding corridors and up and down ramps that twisted and turned to lead into other ramps and corridors. That was the way all public buildings were designed. It was forbidden for the government to make any law-abiding individual think the way it wanted him to think. But it could move him in any direction it chose, and sometimes that served its purpose as well as the reorientation machines."}, {"id": "32688", "title": "The Ordeal of Colonel Johns", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Arthur Campbell Yate", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QzcoAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32688/32688-h/32688-h.htm", "desc": "This collection includes the letters and diaries of US Army colonel John Hart Caughey, who served in the China theater in the final years of World War II.

And most of them think it could never happen to them. Because they don't recognize the subtle danger signs, they can suddenly find themselves in a dangerous relationship -- with devastating consequences. It can start off innocently enough. Someone cares enough to pay attention. To look into your eyes. To touch with understanding. Even with the best of motives, it's easy to slip gradually, almost imperceptibly, into the snare of an emotional or sexual entanglement. In The Snare -- a frank, sometimes startling book -- Lois Mowday Rabey gives us a clear look at the paths to sexual immorality using real-life accounts of Christians who have struggled and failed. She returns repeatedly to the single focus that conquers temptation: a strong personal relationship with Christ. And she outlines the clear guidelines in Scripture for establishing healthy relationships in today's value neutral\u00d3 world. Rabey offers specific advice for conduct in the workplace (where many affairs begin), for gracefully getting out of compromising situations, and for single adults (whether never married, widowed, or divorced). We shouldn't push the issue of immorality aside because we seem to be okay, because we feel secure in the center of an evangelical church, have daily devotions, and memorize Scripture,\u00d3 writes Rabey. We can have all these right practices and more, yet still fall.\u00d3 Emotional and sexual entanglements are a snare. They are so enticing, so promising, and they offer something that seems so good. Lois Mowday Rabey helps us see them for the dangerous trap they really are. And she offers help to those wanting to avoid the snare or escape its grasp. Whether you work with people who struggle with this issue or you just want to protect yourself against the subtle snare of immorality, 'The Snare' is an invaluable resource."}, {"id": "29437", "title": "The Martian Cabal", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Roman Frederick Starzl", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j-UKkAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29437/29437-h/29437-h.htm", "desc": "Roman Frederick Starzl was an American author.

One crucial problem about mediation concerns the dimensions of its modeling effect, particularly the precise status and constellation of the mediating agents, i.e. author, narrator or presenter and characters. The question is how are the structure and the meaning of the story conditioned by these different positions in relation to the mediated happenings perceived from outside and/or inside the storyworld? In this volume, fourteen articles by international scholars from seven different countries address these problems anew from various angles, reviewing the sub-categorization of mediation and re-specifying its dimensions both in literary texts and other media such as drama and theater, film, and computer games"}, {"id": "22301", "title": "Valley of Dreams", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Lauraine Snelling", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7ODd_YZRCYYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22301/22301-h/22301-h.htm", "desc": "When Cassie Lockwood's father dies and the manager of his Wild West show drives it into debt before taking off with the remaining money, she decides to look for the hidden valley where her father dreamed of settling."}, {"id": "22890", "title": "The Worlds of If", "genre": "Science", "language": "en", "author": "Stanely G Weinbaum", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YEoVBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22890/22890-h/22890-h.htm", "desc": "Join Haskel van Manderpootz and Dixon Wells in another adventure!

He described his stories as \"a miscellany of inventions,\" yet his enthusiasm for science was tempered by an awareness of its horrifying destructive powers and the threat it could pose to the human race.

A fascinating and prophetic novel, \"The World Set Free\" is highly recommended for fans of vintage speculative fiction. Herbert George Wells (1866 - 1946) was a prolific English writer who wrote in a variety of genres, including the novel, politics, history, and social commentary. Today, he is perhaps best remembered for his contributions to the science fiction genre thanks to such novels as \"The Time Machine\" (1895), \"The Invisible Man\" (1897), and \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898).

When a bishop is elected in The United Methodist Church, it is not only the one elected who is asked to serve but his or her spouse and family as well. Hear the stories of how Methodist and United Methodist episcopal spouses have adjusted to and navigated this life-changing journey. While dealing with the full range of human experience\u2014births, deaths, relationship struggles, and illness\u2014they also travel the world, participate in mission and ceremonies, meet interesting people, and stand up for justice. Through hardships, celebrations, and everyday struggles, these spouses find their own paths of ministry, answering the calls that are also placed upon their lives. In these ways and many others, they also serve. Praise for They Also Served A meticulous labor of love by Jane P. Ives, They Also Served remembers faithful unsung Christians by chronicling previously unrecorded details of the spouses of episcopal leaders. Sometimes in the spotlight, often in the shadows, the bishop's spouses struggled to fulfill unpaid roles and undefined responsibilities in the church, usually far from family and friends. Ives empatheticlly highlights how these persons, usually without voice or vote, helped shape the church's mission and ministry. - Dr. Donald E. Messer, Executive Director, Central for Health and Hope: Focusing on Global HIV and AIDS, Centennial Colorado. Bishops may ebb and flow in their popularity based on their decisions, but their spouses are almost universally loved and admired. Jane Ives helps readers understand why that is the case with her comprehensive story of the impressive, diverse, and thoroughly dedicated women and men who have contributed so much to God's work. \u2014Lovett H. Weems, Jr., Distinguished Professor of Church Leadership Emeritus, Wesley Theological Seminary, Washington, DC In the gospel of Luke, Jesus sent the disciples out, two by two, to every town, and country, every charge and conference. Ives' book records the wisdom of sending two, and restores the names of those often forgotten in the story of the people called \"Methodists,\" the spouses. These are remarkable oral histories as well as timelines of social holiness and global service. This is not a book about survival in ministry and marriage; it's a testimony to those who thrived in their calling. \u2014Heather Murray Elkins, Professor of Worship, Preaching, and the Arts, The Theological School of Drew University, Madison, New Jersey This is a book about discipleship. It is also a book about ministry and itinerancy. It tells stories of how God sometimes calls two people to the work of episcopacy, people who happen to be married to each other. It is a book that will make you laugh and cry! This book is an important addition to the literature of Methodist episcopacy. And it is a hard book to put down! \u2014William Boyd Grove, Bishop (Ret.) of The United Methodist Church Jane Ives has given the Methodist family a priceless treasure. Through an astonishing effort to collect memories and explore archival material, she has compiled a comprehensive record of episcopal spouses, their stories, accomplishments, and contributions to the church. But this book is more than a biographical dictionary. It offers a poignant, insightful account of the lives of bishops, their spouses and families, and the impact of the church's expectations on all of them. As a little boy, I knew firsthand the phone call: get on a train to New Orleans with your sister; your Daddy is going to be a bishop. Allow me to testify, then, that this book is the real deal -- genuine, human, and rich with faith and Spirit. \u2014Thomas E. Frank, Associate Dean for Continuing Studies, Graduate School of Arts and Science, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina Laity and clergy active in United Methodist life and their spouses will want to immerse themselves in this \"corporate\" autobiography, which provides an overview of Methodism through almost 80 years of personal experiences and cultural change. Jane Ives, an episcopal spouse, has amassed here narratives, reports, and communications crafted by her spousal \"colleagues,\" living and dead, as well as by those who have known them. For page after page, the reader will relive Methodism's sometimes gradual, sometimes dramatic evolution and its struggles with race, gender, inclusivity, and global relationships. The bishops' spouses have shown great creativity in making the most of their opportunities to be together during Council meetings: sharing ideas, establishing covenant and interest groups, and adjusting their organization to respond to changing needs. Ives has devoted the final third of the book to profiles of the spouses, some quite famous and others whose names are not even known. These vignettes illustrate how different episcopal spouses have lived out their own calling and how they have impacted the church and the world. \u2014Russell E.

The State of Kerala has been hailed as a success story in accommodating gender concerns in local-level planning and political decentralisation; this conclusion has been based on relatively simple evaluative exercises that ask whether women of diverse backgrounds have gained entry into formal institutions of governance or not. This book seeks to place political decentralisation and its possibilities for women within the historical and contemporary contexts. Against the popular assumption that the liberal feminist promise made by the state will be delivered, say, once the noxious influence of male relatives is removed, the book points to the multiple social forces that shape possibilities and hindrances for women, and reshape gender divisions in the political field. The book thus pays attention to women in both local governance and politics. Secondly, it examines how women have utilised, extended, survived within or subverted these spaces. In the present context in which fifty per cent of the seats in the institutions of local self-government are being reserved for women, and there exists considerable skepticism about reservations for women in the Parliament, this book offers reflections on both local governance and \u2018high\u2019 politics.

Spring 1916: the horror of a stalemate on Europe\u2019s western front. France and Great Britain are on one side of the barbed wire, a fierce German army is on the other. Shaara opens the window onto the otherworldly tableau of trench warfare as seen through the eyes of a typical British soldier who experiences the bizarre and the horrible\u2013a \u201cTommy\u201d whose innocent youth is cast into the hell of a terrifying war. In the skies, meanwhile, technology has provided a devastating new tool, the aeroplane, and with it a different kind of hero emerges\u2013the flying ace. Soaring high above the chaos on the ground, these solitary knights duel in the splendor and terror of the skies, their courage and steel tested with every flight. As the conflict stretches into its third year, a neutral America is goaded into war, its reluctant president, Woodrow Wilson, finally accepting the repeated challenges to his stance of nonalignment. Yet the Americans are woefully unprepared and ill equipped to enter a war that has become worldwide in scope. The responsibility is placed on the shoulders of General John \u201cBlackjack\u201d Pershing, and by mid-1917 the first wave of the American Expeditionary Force arrives in Europe. Encouraged by the bold spirit and strength of the untested Americans, the world waits to see if the tide of war can finally be turned. From Blackjack Pershing to the Marine in the trenches, from the Red Baron to the American pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille, To the Last Man is written with the moving vividness and accuracy that characterizes all of Shaara\u2019s work.

Kuno, der Sohn des Grafen, liegt krank im Bett und wird von zwei Frauen betreut, von seiner alten Amme und von seiner Stiefmutter, einer g\u00fctigen jungen Frau. Die Amme erz\u00e4hlt ihr, dass es in diesem Schloss nicht nur gute Stiefm\u00fctter hat und sie f\u00e4ngt an zu erz\u00e4hlen: In diesem Schloss lebte einst ein kluger und guter Graf, dessen Frau von allen ,,die gute Gr\u00e4fin\" genannt wurde. Sie war bek\u00fcmmert, weil sie scheinbar keine Kinder bekommen konnte. Als der weise Zauberer Cyprianus verwundet und von Gr\u00e4fin gesund gepflegt wird, entwickelt sich eine Freundschaft zwischen den beiden. Die Gr\u00e4fin erz\u00e4hlt dem Zauberer von ihrem Kummer. Cyprianus schickt ihr nach seiner Abreise einen Spiegel, in den sie immer wieder schauen solle. Sie solle aber wissen, dass sie Gottes Wege nicht umleiten k\u00f6nne und dass der Spiegel niemals eine Bluttat sehen d\u00fcrfe, sonst werde sich das Schicksal gegen die Nachkommen richten. Die Frau sieht von nun an jeden Tag in den Spiegel, und eines Tages sieht sie im Spiegel einen Nebel, aus dem ein Kindergesicht auftaucht. Doch nur ihrem Mann f\u00e4llt auf, dass das Bildnis Kind im Spiegel weint. Bald bringt sie einen Jungen zur Welt, der Kuno genannt wird, so wie der Stiefsohn der sp\u00e4teren Gr\u00e4fin. Bald nach Kunos Geburt stirbt die Mutter an einer Seuche. Die Trauer ist gro\u00df. Einige Jahre sp\u00e4ter beschlie\u00dft der Graf, sich in Wien eine neue Frau zu suchen. Die Frau, die er aus Wien mitbringt, ist wundersch\u00f6n, und jeder, der sie sieht, ist ihrem Zauber verfallen, bis auf Kuno und den klugen Hausmeister. Ein fremder Oberst namens Hager kommt an den Hof, der sich als Vetter des ehemaligen Ehemannes der neuen Gr\u00e4fin ausgibt. Er bleibt am Hof und geht h\u00e4ufig mit dem Grafen auf die Jagd. Doch eines Tages verungl\u00fcckt der Graf bei einer Wildschweinjagd und seine Witwe bleibt die alleinige Herrscherin \u00fcber das Schloss. Inzwischen hat sie einen Sohn geboren, der den Namen Wolf tr\u00e4gt. Die beiden Halbbr\u00fcder lieben einander innig, auch wenn der Oberst immer wieder versucht, einen Keil zwischen beide zu treiben, und die Gr\u00e4fin w\u00fcrde Kuno lieber tot zu sehen. Sie verspricht Hager, Herr \u00fcber das Schloss zu werden, wenn er Kuno umbringt. Aus Zufall t\u00f6tet er Kuno vor dem Spiegel des Cyprianus, und als sein j\u00fcngerer Bruder eines Tages in den Spiegel sieht, entsteht auf seiner Brust der gleiche rote Fleck wie bei seinem Bruder, und er stirbt ebenfalls. Hier endet die Erz\u00e4hlung der alten Amme. Erschrocken stellt die junge Stiefmutter fest, dass die b\u00f6se Gr\u00e4fin aus der Geschichte ihre eigene Vorfahrin ist.

Die Gestalten, die das Geschehen dieses okkulten Schl\u00fcsselromans durchziehen, zeigen die m\u00f6glichen Wege und Irrwege zu diesem h\u00f6chsten aller Ziele auf, das in den Schlu\u00dfworten dieses Buches angedeutet wird: \u00bbWie ein Januskopf konnte Hauberrisser in die jenseitige Welt und zugleich in die irdische Welt hineinblicken und ihre Einzelheiten und Dinge klar unterscheiden: er war h\u00fcben und dr\u00fcben ein lebendiger Mensch. Wer mit sich von diesem Roman eine \"Gebrauchsanweisung\" zur Spiruritualit\u00e4t oder \"esoterisches Wissen\" erhofft hat, wurde nat\u00fcrlich entt\u00e4uscht - schlie\u00dflich beschreibt dieses Buch eben genau die Schwierigkeiten (und Irrwege) auf der Suche nach dieser eigenen Spiritulit\u00e4t! Wer sich f\u00fcr dieses Thema interessiert, kann eigentlich so ziemlich bedenkenlos zugreifen - ganz besonders, da dieses Buch ziemlich packend geschrieben ist, voller Doppeldeutigkeiten und Sprachwitz steckt, und nebenbei auch noch das Kunstst\u00fcck fertigbringt, eine bissige Gesellscahftssatire zu sein! Wie alle B\u00fccher Meyrinks von einer eigent\u00fcmlich dichten okkulten Atmosph\u00e4re durchdrungen sind, die genau den Punkt der Verwandlung eines Menschen betrachten, so ist auch das \"Gr\u00fcne Gesicht\" eine Suche nach der letzten Wahrheit. Die relativ schlichte Rahmenhandlung wird durch die intensive Beschreibung der Charaktere ersetzt, die den inneren Seelenzustand gnadenlos freilegen. Wertvoll ist der Roman speziell auch deshalb, weil er die \"okkulten Fallen\" aufdeckt, wie das \"Channeln und den Spirtimus\"."}, {"id": "23425", "title": "Die Kurtisane Jamaica", "genre": "German fiction", "language": "de", "author": "Hans Bethge", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uAbaDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23425/23425-h/23425-h.htm", "desc": "Hans Bethge: Die Kurtisane Jamaica.

Hoffman's style, which is instructive and moralistic, coupled with the sadistic content of his works lend a unique quality to the stories that we don't see in contemporary children's literature. Struwwelpeter: Humor or Horror? is a critical analysis of the now infamous Struwwelpeter stories. While Hoffman intended his depictions of amputated limbs and burning children to be humorous and to warn children against misbehavior, some find the punishments can be excessively vicious. Looking beyond the history of child rearing practices and children's literature, Barbara Smith Chalou considers the socio-historic context in which the book was written and makes comparisons to contemporary children's fare that is similarly violent, but intended to be humorous."}, {"id": "50136", "title": "Die Oberheudorfer in der Stadt Allerlei heitere Geschichten von den Oberheudorfer Buben und M\u00e4deln", "genre": "Juvenile fiction", "language": "de", "author": "Josephine Siebe", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_exkuwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/50136/50136-h/50136-h.htm", "desc": "\"Neue Kindergeschichten aus Oberheudorf: F\u00fcnfzehn heitere Erz\u00e4hlungen\" von Josephine Siebe.

Er war als Literat nur am Berliner Hof um 1703 namhaft. Dort fiel er der germanistischen Forschung als Gelegenheitsdichter ohne Niveau auf. Alle anderen Werke erschienen unter verschiedenen Pseudonymen, sodass Reuters Autorschaft erst erschlossen werden musste. Ist dieser Reisebericht das erste Satirebuch? Nun, jedenfalls bis heute eines der besten: Die Reisebeschreibung von Christian Reuter aus dem Jahre 1696 ging zu Recht in die deutsche Literaturgeschichte ein, August Gottfried B\u00fcrger nahm sogar die ma\u00dflosen \u00dcbertreibungen als Vorlage f\u00fcr seine M\u00fcnchhausen-Geschichten. Schelmuffsky ist dem \u00e4ltesten Sohn der Wirtin Anna Rosine M\u00fcller aus Leipzig nachgebildet und Ich-Erz\u00e4hler des gleichnamigen Romans in Form einer Reisebeschreibung. Die Germanistik ist sich nicht ganz schl\u00fcssig, ob es sich um einen Schelmenroman, einen Abenteuerroman oder um eine M\u00fcnchhausiade handelt. Der Erz\u00e4hler ist eine Art Kamera, die Eindr\u00fccke ungefiltert wiedergibt. Auf diese Weise charakterisiert er sich selbst, ohne sich dessen bewusst zu sein, indem er im Wesentlichen vom Fressen, Saufen und Sich\u00fcbergeben berichtet. Gleichzeitig gibt er h\u00f6fische Formen und Feste, Galanterie und die damals \u00fcbliche ma\u00dflose \u00dcbertreibung in den vermehrt aufkommenden Reisebeschreibungen der L\u00e4cherlichkeit preis.

Traditionally, the act of writing constitutes a challenge to the finality of death. Yet \"writing\" as a subject for literary texts has its own tradition of imagery whose rhetoric is associated with loss rather than immortality. The limit of death seems to force a more explicit analysis of the process of writing. Writers consider the impact of their work on their readers, or re-articulate the link between the written text and the subject it is meant to represent. Each writer constructs a \"subversive\" text. The conjunction of writing and death--besides highlighting or demystifying the creative act--leads in each case to a decidedly critical stance. Guenther examines how Kleist's and Balzac's representations of death bring with them a critical awareness that calls attention to the historical context in which the texts are produced. \"Especially impressive is the way Guenther shows how the alliance between death and writing can produce two different but fascinating effects: in Kleist, the subversion of the idea of Bildung, and in Balzac, the ingenious strategies of 'endless survival,' most obviously symbolized in the 'totalizing' aspirations of the Comedie Humaine and in his 'exorcism of doubles.'\" -- Maria DiBattista, Princeton University \"A book that goes to the very grounds of our anxieties and relativities, a book that seeks to explore how literature has been able to deal with the most extreme of human margins.\" -- Virgil Nemoianu, Catholic University of America"}, {"id": "35339", "title": "Arme Leute", "genre": "Social life and customs", "language": "de", "author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NtXStAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35339/35339-h/35339-h.htm", "desc": "Arme Leute by Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}, {"id": "23243", "title": "Mister Galgenstrick und andere Humoresken", "genre": "Social life and customs", "language": "de", "author": "Karl Ettlinger", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xrkncDvoKBQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23243/23243-h/23243-h.htm", "desc": "Karl Ettlinger: Mister Galgenstrick und andere Humoresken Erstdruck: Berlin, Ullstein, 1915.

In this book Augustinus Dierick focuses on another significant but hitherto neglected medium of German Expressionist thought \u2013 short narrative prose \u2013 in order to illuminate and evaluate the contribution of that genre to one of the twentieth century's most powerful artistic movements. Dierick's study includes a thorough analysis of the works of a broad range of Expressionist prose writers, from those of such specialists in the genre as Edschmid, Heym, Benn, Loerke, Frank, Sternheim, Ehrenstein, and 'Mynona' to the shorter prose works of such major figures as Alfred D\u00f6blin, Heinrich Mann, Max Brod, and Franz Werfel. Dierick isolates the thematic obsessions common among Expressionist writers: the pathos of the self in confrontation with nature and with God, the tension between self and the institutions of bourgeois society, and the attractions and dangers of eroticism. Throughout Dierick stresses the interrelationship between themes and their formal expression. He examines many apparent excesses in style and tone, many aberrations in structure and generic characteristics, and identifies them not as needless experimentation but as a necessary result of the attempt to find appropriate forms for extreme situations and complex ideas. Dierick's analysis makes clear that Expressionist prose has an intrinsic artistic value and, because of certain nuances and different accents, must be included in any estimation of the nature and importance of Expressionism as a whole."}, {"id": "52486", "title": "Adelina oder Der Abschied vom neunzehnten Lebensjahre Aufzeichnungen", "genre": "Literature", "language": "de", "author": "Paul Raabe", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=31RKAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/52486/52486-h/52486-h.htm", "desc": "Description currently un available"}, {"id": "46551", "title": "Das zerst\u00f6rte Idyll Novellen", "genre": "Literature", "language": "de", "author": "Hans FleschBrunningen", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2sznAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/46551/46551-h/46551-h.htm", "desc": "Wie setzen sich AutorInnen des Expressionismus mit dem modernen Sport auseinander? Andreas Kramer nimmt in seiner Studie neben den expressionistischen Literarisierungen des Sports auch soziokulturelle Kontexte und Codierungen in den Blick und geht damit \u00fcber die blo\u00dfe Motivgeschichte eines kulturhistorischen Ansatzes hinaus. Expressionistische Sporttexte loten h\u00e4ufig als Bestandteile der korporalen und der symbolischen Kultur der Moderne das Spannungsgeflecht von individueller Befreiung und kollektiver Disziplinierung aus. Der Autor zeigt dies an vier Sportarten, die unterschiedliche Wettkampfformen repr\u00e4sentieren, sich ab Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts herausbildeten und rasch zum popul\u00e4ren Massensport bzw. kommerziell organisierten Zuschauersport wurden: Boxen, Tennis, Radrennfahren und Fu\u00dfball. This is the first monograph to examine the role of modern sports in Expressionist literature. Adopting a cultural-historical approach, the study analyses sport themes in Expressionism alongside socio-cultural contexts and meanings. Expressionist texts on sport thus become integral elements of the corporal and the symbolic cultures of modernity that frequently tease out tensions between individual, vitalising liberation and collective, devitalising disciplining of the sporting body. In using boxing, tennis, cycling and football, the study takes as its main examples four sports that arrived in Germany from the late 19th century to quickly become popular mass sports and commercial spectator sports."}, {"id": "45644", "title": "Guirlanden um Die Urnen der Zukunft\r Eine interessante originelle Familiengeschichte aus dem drei und zwanzigsten Jahrhunderte", "genre": "Literature", "language": "de", "author": "A K Ruh", "image": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4fenBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "readLink": "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/45644/45644-h/45644-h.htm", "desc": "Die Welt in 100 Jahren ist Wissenschaftsbuch des Jahres!

Andrea Delfin kommt nach Venedig. Mit sich f\u00fchrt er drei Dolche, jeder tr\u00e4gt die Inschrift: \u00bbTod allen Inquisitoren\u00ab eingraviert. Die Inquisitoren sind im alten Venedig die Vollzugsbeamten der M\u00e4chtigen, sie sind Ankl\u00e4ger, Richter und Vollstrecker in einem. Ihre Herrschaft ist ber\u00fcchtigt. Andrea Delfin will den Tod der Schwester und des Bruders r\u00e4chen. Der Text ist eine spannende Schilderung der Herrschaftsverh\u00e4ltnisse, unter denen Bespitzelung, Verrat aber auch blankes Denunziantentum und politische R\u00e4nke und Meuchelmorde an der Tagesordnung waren. Eine schreckliche Zeit, in der nur Adlige und der Klerus frei waren, alle anderen Menschen mussten damit rechnen jeden Augenblick unter beh\u00f6rdlicher Willk\u00fcr f\u00fcr ewig weggesperrt oder gelyncht zu werden; ein falscher Verdacht, eine getuschelte Bemerkung \u2013 ob wahr oder nicht \u2013 waren genug. \u00bbDen Schafen aber ist es gleich, Herr Delfin, ob sie geschlachtet oder vom Wolf gefressen werden ...\u00ab Mein Bruder wurde nach Venedig gerufen, sich zu verantworten. Als er kam, wurde er unter die Bleid\u00e4cher gef\u00fchrt, und viele Wochen lang suchte man bald durch Drohungen, bald durch verlockende Anerbietungen ihn zu Gest\u00e4ndnissen zu bewegen. Jenen einen Schritt brauchte er nicht zu besch\u00f6nigen; er war gesetzlich. Anderes hatte er nicht zu gestehen, da wir nichts gegen den Staat unternommen hatten. So musste man ihn endlich entlassen. Aber man dachte nicht daran, ihn zu begnadigen. Ich selbst hatte ihn schriftlich gebeten, nicht sogleich abzureisen, um nicht neuen Verdacht zu erwecken. Wir wollten ihn lieber einige Monate l\u00e4nger entbehren. Als er endlich kam, sollten wir ihn nach wenigen Tagen f\u00fcr immer missen. Er erlag einem langsam wirkenden Gift, das man ihm in einem der gl\u00e4nzenden H\u00e4user, die er besuchte, unter die Speisen gemischt hatte. Noch war der Stein \u00fcber seinem Grabe nicht aufgerichtet, als der Gouverneur der Provinz meiner Schwester seine Hand antrug. Sie wies sie mit Entr\u00fcstung zur\u00fcck; in ihrem Schmerz entfuhren ihr Worte, die ihren Nachhall im Saal des Inquisitionstribunals finden sollten.
